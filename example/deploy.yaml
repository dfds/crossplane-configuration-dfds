  # Support for a compositionRef is automatically injected into the schema of
  # all defined composite resources. This allows the resource
  # author to explicitly reference a Composition that this composite resource
  # should use - in this case the earlier example-azure Composition. Note that
  # it is also possible to select a composition by labels - see the below
  # MySQLInstance for an example of this approach.

  # Support for a writeConnectionSecretToRef is automatically injected into the
  # schema of all defined composite resources. This allows the
  # resource to write a connection secret containing any details required to
  # connect to it - in this case the hostname, username, and password. Composite
  # resource authors may omit this reference if they do not need or wish to
  # write these details.
